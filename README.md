# Amazon-Product-Scraper
This project implements an automated bot (Autobot) using Python and Selenium to scrape product data from Amazon. It extracts details such as product title, price, image URL, and reviews, storing the data in JSON files. Additionally, it provides a FastAPI-based web API for accessing the scraped product data.
